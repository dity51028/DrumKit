# DrumKit
This is a funny project ,when you press the key in keyboard the corresponding sound will play in the background.
I've created this small project using HTML,CSS and JS. In this project I am working with audio in HTML and try to give little animation using css . 
For JS file I am working with transition and transitionend features.
